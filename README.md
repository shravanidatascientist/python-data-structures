# Python Data Structures – Lists & Tuples

This repository contains my practice and notes on **List and Tuple data structures in Python**

---

##  Topics Covered

###  Lists
- What is a List?
- Creating Lists
- Accessing elements
- Indexing & Slicing
- List methods:
  - append()
  - insert()
  - remove()
  - pop()
  - sort()
  - reverse()
- Nested Lists
- List vs Tuple comparison

###  Tuples
- What is a Tuple?
- Creating Tuples
- Indexing & Slicing
- Tuple methods:
  - count()
  - index()
- Immutability of Tuples
- Use cases of Tuples

##  Key Learnings
- Lists are **mutable** and suitable for dynamic data.
- Tuples are **immutable** and useful when data should not change.
- Choosing the right data structure improves performance and code safety.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
